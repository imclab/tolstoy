    This is an Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS).

    It describes data on Infochimps.org and is meant to be both human
    and machine readable.

    An ICSS file is distributed with every download on Infochimps and
    is also available by request to the above URL.
    
    ICSS files bundled with downloads are generated at the time the
    download was created so they can become out of date as changes are
    made to the data.  If this ICSS came with data you downloaded then
    it is possible that it is already out of date.  You can get the
    most recent version at the URL above.

        The Twitter API currently consists of two discrete APIs. Most application developers mix and match the APIs to produce their application. The separation of the REST and Search APIs is less than ideal and it is entirely due to history It is in our pipeline to ameliorate Twitter's API by combining the Search and REST pieces as development cycles allow. The API Overview portion of the Getting Started series explains the history.
